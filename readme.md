# Challenge week 8

## Series ðŸŽ¥

Here you have a HTML and CSS layout application. It is an application that manages a list of series, separating them between watched and unwatched series.

## Requeriments

-   This application will be fed from a JS object that you have in the `series.js` file.
-   You have to show a list of series, separating them between watched and unwatched.
-   Each series has to show all the information you see in the layout.
-   If the series is unviewed, its stars have to be set to 0 and the user should be able to click to rate the series with the stars he/she thinks necessary.
-   When clicking on a star, the application should modify the rating and the series should go from unviewed to viewed (there is no way to move a series from viewed to unviewed).
-   If the user clicks on the x icon, the series should be deleted.
